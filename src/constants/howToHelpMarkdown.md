# Why Volunteer?

The most efficient way to bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end is with safe and effective vaccines, manufactured in large quantities and distributed globally. In order to do that, we need to test these vaccines in clinical trials, which will require an unprecedented number of healthy volunteers.

One little known fact about the development of new vaccines and treatments is that getting volunteers to enroll in clinical trials can take months and years - it is typically the most time-consuming and unpredictable part of clinical trial execution. The faster people like you enroll in these trials, the faster a vaccine or treatment will be on the market for the benefit of all.

So how big of an impact could you and other volunteers have? It is difficult to estimate due to uncertainty around the rate of COVID-19 spread and mitigating factors. However, **accelerating a successful vaccine would likely** **save tens if not hundreds of thousands of lives**. Since April 1st 2020, COVID has killed 5,480 people per day on average, and that number has been trending upwards and is likely an [undercount](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768086). If each additional approved vaccine could prevent 10% of these deaths, speeding up just one vaccine could save 548 lives per day or 16,659 per month.

You might also benefit personally from volunteering as you would get access to a vaccine or treatment sooner than the general population if the following conditions are met: you are placed in the investigational treatment arm of the study (as opposed to the arm with the placebo or an already available treatment; you will not know which arm you are assigned) AND the vaccine or treatment turns out to be effective. If either condition is not met, you should still take satisfaction that you helped advance the product or that you helped further medical knowledge. You will also receive a thorough medical exam and a COVID-19 test as part of the standard of care, plus a stipend for your time and/or travel up to \$1,250 (in the US).

## How to Help

### IF YOU ARE HEALTHY

**1. Volunteer for a clinical trial near you**

Enrolling enough patients can sometimes hold up a trial for months or years. Some vaccine studies will have to enroll 60,000 patients and the faster the trial is enrolled, the faster we will know whether the intervention works. Check our FAQ for questions around safety and what volunteering entails.

- If you are in the US, first sign up at the NIH’s [COVID-19 Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/). If you are not in the US or have completed that task, go to our [homepage](https://coviddash.org/) and find clinical trials near you by clicking on the markers.

- Click the “How to Volunteer” link to be provided with contact information for reaching out to express interest in volunteering. We recommend reaching out in the following order of preference: 1) via website 2) emailing 3) calling.

- _optional_: You can also check for trials by location on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/map?recrs=a&cond=coronavirus+OR+corona+OR+covid+OR+sars+OR+acute+respiratory+OR+ards+OR+pneumonia&hlth=Y&map=) (recommended for most nationalities), [EU Clinical Trial Registry](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=coronavirus+OR+corona+OR+covid+OR+sars+OR+acute+respiratory+OR+ards+OR+pneumonia&status=ongoing), [Chinese Trial Registry](http://www.chictr.org.cn/enindex.aspx), [Japanese Trial Registry](https://jrct.niph.go.jp/), [Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry](https://anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx#&&conditionCode=&dateOfRegistrationFrom=&interventionDescription=&interventionCodeOperator=OR&primarySponsorType=&gender=&distance=&postcode=&pageSize=20&ageGroup=&recruitmentCountryOperator=OR&recruitmentRegion=&ethicsReview=&countryOfRecruitment=Australia%7cNew+Zealand&registry=&searchTxt=COVID+19+OR+%22SARS-CoV2%22+OR+%222019-nCoV%22&studyType=&allocationToIntervention=&dateOfRegistrationTo=&recruitmentStatus=&interventionCode=&healthCondition=&healthyVolunteers=&page=1&conditionCategory=&fundingSource=&trialStartDateTo=&trialStartDateFrom=&phase=) or the [WHO Trial Registry](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table). Make sure you find trials that accept “healthy volunteers.”

**2. Donate Blood**

There is a [serious shortage of blood donations](https://whyy.org/articles/how-covid-19-led-to-a-blood-shortage-and-why-thats-troubling/). Consider donating blood to potentially [save up to three lives](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/donate-covid-19-plasma). Look for a blood donation center near you.

1. [AABB](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx) (US)
2. [America’s Blood Centers](http://www.americasblood.org/) (US)
3. [American Red Cross](https://www.redcrossblood.org/) (US)
4. [Armed Services Blood Program](https://www.militarydonor.com/) (US)
5. [Blood Centers of America](http://bca.coop/) (US)

**3. Volunteer for a Human Challenge Trial**.

After carefully reviewing and considering the serious medical risks, consider expressing interest in volunteering for a Human Challenge Trial. These types of studies could significantly accelerate vaccine development. Find out more and sign up at [1DaySooner.org](https://1daysooner.org/)

### IF YOU HAVE COVID-19

**1. Get Better.**
First and foremost you should consult with your doctor or medical professional and follow their [recommendations](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/management-of-covid-19/). Even if you happen to have milder symptoms and are in quarantine at home, your first priority should be to get better.

**2. Volunteer for a clinical trial near you.**
If you have milder symptoms, have not had a trial offered to you at your healthcare point of care, and still feel like you could and would want to help, you could see if there are clinical trials near you enrolling COVID patients with milder symptoms.

- Go to [ClinicalTrials.Gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/map?recrs=a&cond=coronavirus+OR+corona+OR+covid+OR+sars+OR+acute+respiratory+OR+ards+OR+pneumonia&map=) and click on your country/state. The list of studies contain trials that are either for healthy subjects or for patients with COVID, make sure the study you are volunteering for is for patients with COVID. To find the contact information, scroll down on a study page to the “Contacts and Locations” section. You can also find studies in other geographies [EU Clinical Trial Registry](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=coronavirus+OR+corona+OR+covid+OR+sars+OR+acute+respiratory+OR+ards+OR+pneumonia&status=ongoing), [Chinese Trial Registry](http://www.chictr.org.cn/enindex.aspx), [Japanese Trial Registry](https://jrct.niph.go.jp/), [Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry](https://anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx#&&conditionCode=&dateOfRegistrationFrom=&interventionDescription=&interventionCodeOperator=OR&primarySponsorType=&gender=&distance=&postcode=&pageSize=20&ageGroup=&recruitmentCountryOperator=OR&recruitmentRegion=&ethicsReview=&countryOfRecruitment=Australia%7cNew+Zealand&registry=&searchTxt=COVID+19+OR+%22SARS-CoV2%22+OR+%222019-nCoV%22&studyType=&allocationToIntervention=&dateOfRegistrationTo=&recruitmentStatus=&interventionCode=&healthCondition=&healthyVolunteers=&page=1&conditionCategory=&fundingSource=&trialStartDateTo=&trialStartDateFrom=&phase=) or the [WHO Trial Registry](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table)

### IF YOU HAVE FULLY RECOVERED FROM COVID-19

**1. Donate Convalescent Plasma**.
People who have recovered from COVID-19 develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. These antibodies are proteins that might help fight the infection in others.

- Confirm that you had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and that you have complete resolutions of symptoms for at least 14 days.
- Look for a donation center near you:

1. [AAB ](https://covidplasma.org/)(US)
2. [America’s Blood Centers](http://www.americasblood.org/) (US)
3. [American Red Cross](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/plasma-donations-from-recovered-covid-19-patients.html) (US)
4. [Blood Centers of America](http://bca.coop/) (US)
5. [CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance](https://www.covig-19plasmaalliance.org/en-us#info) (US) CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance doesn't just use the plasma as collected, but it is [further processed into a medicine](https://www.covig-19plasmaalliance.org/en-us#comparison) called hyperimmune globulin.
