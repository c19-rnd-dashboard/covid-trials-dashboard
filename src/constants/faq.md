# Frequently Asked Questions

## ABOUT VOLUNTEERING

### What should I know if I want to volunteer for a clinical trial?

By volunteering, you will be agreeing to be administered a vaccine that has been approved by the appropriate federal regulatory bodies (such as the Federal Drug Administration) for investigational use. All products will have gone through extensive pre-clinical tests (i.e. in vitro and in animals) to check that they are safe enough to be tested in humans.

Before participating in the study, you will be given a thorough medical evaluation and asked questions to determine if you are eligible to participate. You will be asked to review an informed consent form, which will provide key facts about the study and detail any risks. You will be free to ask questions to decide whether you want to participate, and during the course of the study, you will be able to stop participating at any time.

There are general risks in participating in a clinical trial: there may be unpleasant, serious or even life-threatening side effects to experimental interventions (see vaccine safety Q&A below)

Many studies will split volunteers into two or more groups: typically one group will receive the investigation product (the “active” or “treatment” group) and another group will receive a placebo or an already available vaccine or treatment (the “placebo” or “control” group). You will likely not know whether you are receiving the active or the control intervention.

The study will typically involve multiple visits to the trial site and you will typically be reimbursed for any travel expenses and perhaps receive a stipend. Some trials might require additional information that needs to be collected at home or, in rare instances, might require overnight stays at a trial site.

Your information will be treated as confidential and private. While the investigator, the research team, the Investigational Review Board and a Contract Research Organization might have access to your personal information, no identifying information will be shared in the trial results to the general public.

You can learn more at the NIH’s “[Are Clinical Studies For You](https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/participate/studies1.html)?” page.

### What if I don’t find a clinical study I can volunteer for near me?

You might still be able to help those in need, please check out our Why Volunteer page. We also recommend checking back on a regular basis (every 2-4 weeks) as there are [multiple large vaccine studies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhqY4CdpHGn5wS8L3-P6f3nXPQ4PAk2iIGz8Pa9y7r9PH2n6tZIsipy6-3weYM1PiFs5i9p-ivNwL-/pub) that will be starting over the next few months.

### Why should I volunteer if we already have a first generation vaccine(s) on its way (e.g. Pfizer/BioNTech’s) that has a 95% efficacy?

While it is great news that Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna announced positive efficacy results, we do in fact still need more volunteers or more vaccine clinical trials. The reasons are two-fold:

The first reason is that each vaccine has a limited manufacturing capacity, for example Pfizer can only manufacture vaccines for [650 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2020/11/10/what-you-need-to-know-about-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine/?sh=170a8da04c46) people in 2021. Therefore the more vaccines that are on the market, the more **overall **manufacturing capacity we have in the world. If we assume each vaccine will be able to manufacture a similar amount of doses (which is unlikely as not all biotechs or pharma companies have the resources of Pfizer or can count on ease of manufacturing of a mRNA vaccine) we would need almost 9 different vaccines to be on the market to immunize 70% of the global population in 2021.

The second response is that subsequent vaccines, sometimes referred to as second generation vaccines, might have improvements over first generation vaccines. One already apparent downside to Pfizer’s vaccine, for example, is that it requires up to [-80°C storage capacity](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-race-turns-deep-freezers-into-a-hot-commodity-11599217201) to ensure stability, entailing the purchase or rental of mobile cold-storage units. [Other vaccines](https://twitter.com/Mesmer21/status/1323108999449976833/photo/1) do not have this problem, such as Inovio’s vaccine that is room temperature stable for up to 1 year. A vaccine that does not require refrigeration would be critical to successfully inoculating underdeveloped parts of the world that do not have a robust cold-storage supply chain infrastructure. The most exciting improvement overall would likely be if subsequent vaccines provide [greater efficacy and greater durability of protection,](https://www.corona-stocks.com/vbis-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-second-generation-game-changer/) either due to inherent benefits of the new vaccine platforms or due to the addition of [adjuvants](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-27/second-generation-covid-vaccines-are-built-for-impact-over-speed). Besides the obvious benefit of greater efficacy, the practical implication is that these vaccines might only require one single dose instead of two doses administered weeks apart and that they might not require booster shots as frequently or at all compared to first-generation vaccines. This would minimize the needs to manufacture multiple doses per person. Also, while it is unclear whether Pfizer’s vaccine (and other mRNA vaccines) provide protection from just the illness/symptoms of an infection, thereby preventing morbidities and mortalities, or, on top of this, actually prevent infection so that the vaccinated person can no longer spread COVID, it is likely that Pfizer’s vaccine only provides the former protection. This means that [subsequent vaccines that can prevent infection](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/the-first-covid-vaccines-may-not-prevent-you-from-getting-covid) with a similar or greater level of efficacy at preventing the illness would be far superior at controlling the pandemic as a whole. Other vaccines might also provide greater efficacy for the most at-risk patient populations including [more detailed subpopulation data](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/covid-19-vaccine-trials/) to support those claims. Lastly, although the first-generation vaccines do not have serious safety concerns that would preclude anyone from taking the vaccine, there are temporary and mild adverse effects such as headache, sore arms, fatigue, chills, and fever and subsequent vaccines might have milder or less frequent adverse events. Speed is of the essence because as these vaccines are rolled out (and as more of the population is infected and developed immunity) it will be harder and harder to enroll patients.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Will a vaccine solve all our problems?

A fully successful vaccine would provide immunity against SARS-CoV2 to [at least 70% of the population](https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/as-covid-vaccines-race-ahead-fda-official-weighs-timelines-challenge-trials-and-more) to achieve herd immunity. Having said that, a vaccine might not be a magic bullet: it might only provide immunity for [months or a year](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/could-covid-19-immunity-really-disappear-months/614377/), [only prevent pneumonia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/why-we-might-not-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine), [keep it to an upper respiratory illness](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/22/the-world-needs-covid-19-vaccines-it-may-also-be-overestimating-their-power/), just reduce the amount of virus an infected person generates or only immunize [less than 70% of the population](https://endpts.com/peter-marks-on-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-euas-and-challenge-trials/).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Are there any risks if I volunteer for a vaccine clinical study? Are there any risks if we accelerate development too fast?

Yes, there are always risks when testing a new intervention. So far the side effects in the vaccines tested to date have been [mild](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/27/covid-19-vaccines-may-cause-mild-side-effects-experts-say-stressing-need-for-education-not-alarm/), and fall in the category of reactogenic side effects such as headache, sore arms, fatigue, chills, and fever. Assessing the risks of COVID-19 vaccines will be very important, since a vast majority of the population (as in millions, if not billions of people) would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Side effects would have to remain mild.

Risks for vaccines that are not properly studied include [acute anaphylaxis](https://medium.com/@hannu_64912/six-months-to-a-vaccine-7ebc9e9018a8) in response to the antigen or the adjuvant, [vaccine-induced allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890451/) or autoimmune diseases, increased severity of illness due to [antibody-dependent enhancement](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/22/Sciadv.abc7428.full) (ADE), [increased risk of developing the disease caused by the virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9), and other [adverse events or serious adverse events](https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/nia-ae-and-sae-guidelines-2018.pdf) in a percentage of the treatment population.

Having said that, keep in mind modern vaccines and treatments are [very safe](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17588088/vaccine-side-effects-autism) and have [saved tens of millions of lives just in the last decade](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/infographics/immunization/global_impact_of_vaccines.htm) -- the smallpox vaccine has saved [150 to 200 million people](https://ourworldindata.org/microbes-battle-science-vaccines) since its introduction. The aim of the clinical trials underway is to ensure the COVID vaccines have a similar level of safety and success.

## ABOUT THE DATA

### Where does the data on COVID Trials Dash come from?

The data comes from publicly available sources of information. For the clinical trials, we typically pull information from NIH’s ClinicalTrials.Gov website or other clinical trial registries. For other information we preferably use data from the sponsor companies themselves (i.e. press releases or their website). To fill in the gaps we use reputable news sources, or (if the above is not available) other trackers/sources. Each datapoint should have a corresponding source link, please refer to the[ full dataset here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11FlafRMeQ2D6doEX_CMHyW4OqnXkp1FfrkLdsxhd0do/edit?usp=sharing). The products are researched by our 30+ subject matter expert volunteers. These subject matter experts have degrees and/or extensive experience in biology, medicine, biotech, public health, or clinical development. For more details on how we gather and enter the information, you can refer to our[ Data Entry SOP here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kTfdAUy-GyzRKLkz5dpAGJdj3DauJMfaeXK_Xs0m7U/edit?usp=sharing). Regarding how we find the products or interventions, we scour press releases, articles and other trackers (we particularly want to credit the [WHO’s Vaccine tracker](https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines), [Milken Institute’s tracker](https://milkeninstitute.org/covid-19-tracker), and [BioWorld’s tracker](https://www.bioworld.com/COVID19products)).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### How do I provide feedback or notify you about an error in your data?

Please contact us at [covidrnd@gmail.com](mailto:covidrnd@gmail.com). If you are a sponsor we would love to receive input, either general input or detailed feedback on your clinical trials, your actual timelines or on timeline projections. We would be more than happy to remove any information if requested, or (preferably) replace the information with a sponsor’s suggestions. If you don’t work for the sponsor but have identified an error, please let us know as well at [covidrnd@gmail.com](mailto:covidrnd@gmail.com), we would appreciate you letting us know!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Why don’t I see a particular company or intervention?

We might have missed it or haven’t heard about it yet! If so, please email us at [covidrnd@gmail.com](mailto:covidrnd@gmail.com) and let us know. Alternatively, you might not see a company or intervention because we have tried to only include companies that are exploring one or a select few product candidates in the “discovery” stage of development and have thus excluded companies that are screening candidates amongst vast libraries of compounds. We have also excluded diagnostics, medical devices and digital health products as they have different goals and/or very different regulatory pathways and timelines.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Why do I only see the location of the clinical trial sites, but not their name and exact address?

While we believe it is helpful to show the location of actively recruiting clinical trial sites, we have refrained from providing the names and identifying information of the sites on the map feature because we don’t want to incentivize people to reach out to the sites directly, and instead opt for the recommended contact options provided by the sponsor.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ABOUT THE TIMELINES

### How should I read the timeline graph?

The timeline represents the [typical steps or stages](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/making-vaccines/process-vaccine-development) from discovery of an intervention by scientists to it being approved by regulators, manufactured by the sponsor and available on the market to people in need. These stages are put in their typical sequential process, but keep in mind certain stages can be skipped (e.g. Moderna skipped preclinical testing), combined (as in combining Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies into a combined Phase 1/2 study) or performed out of order or in-parallel (e.g. [Bill Gates will help fund vaccine factories while studies are still ongoing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-to-spend-billions-on-coronavirus-vaccine-development-11586124716)). The stages as displayed represent the amount of time each stage is the rate-limiting step (i.e. on the critical path) to progressing, not the overall duration of that stage. For example, a Phase 2 trial can last 12 months to collect all the primary and secondary endpoint data, but from its beginning until the point that the subsequent Phase 3 study could start only requires enough data to get regulatory approval to proceed, which might be just 6 months worth of primary endpoint data. Therefore in our timeline this Phase 1 stage would be represented by 6 months, not 12 months.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Where do the optimistic and pessimistic vaccine projections come from?

Clinical development efforts for COVID-19 vaccines are being greatly accelerated compared to typical timelines (see[ NEJM article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630?query=RP) and [Morgan Stanley reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanleys-timeline-for-coronavirus-vaccines-in-2020-2020-7)). While some articles claimed[ millions of doses could be available by September](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html), many estimates are more nuanced (see[ NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)) or pessimistic (see[ Fierce Biotech articles](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/don-t-count-a-covid-19-vaccine-for-at-least-five-years-says-ai-based-forecast)). Our [estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15wWq7qsaRkJ3c51vcpHZl3YQJwZB9GSHsKkN9OmLMws/edit?usp=sharing) assume vaccines will go through full regulatory approval and our end date is when the vaccine is available on the market. For the optimistic projections we have, when possible, used the existing timelines that have been achieved by companies (e.g.[ Moderna’s timelines](https://www.modernatx.com/modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19) from discovery to Phase 3). For prospective stages we have assumed best estimates based on the current sample size and study design for later stage studies. In the pessimistic scenario we have used more standard development timelines. We realize that different vaccine types will have vastly[ different clinical development timelines](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630?query=RP). We are working on providing more vaccine-platform-dependent projections. In addition, since we cannot tailor our projections due to the size of the sponsor company and its ability to bring resources to bear on R&D (yet), the optimistic scenario therefore assumes Big Pharma level of R&D speed and the pessimistic scenario assumes a small-biotech level of R&D speed to try to cover the full range of timeline possibilities.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Have you taken into account vaccine manufacturing timelines? Will I be able to get a vaccine when it’s on the market?

We have only assumed the first dose of the vaccine being available, not necessarily it being manufactured at scale necessary to distribute across entire regions. Even if a vaccine is approved in the US, for example, it could still take [a year and half](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/28/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-distribution/) to distribute 300 million doses. For the first dose timeline we have used estimates provided by the leading sponsors and their funding partners (such as the U.S. Government with its [Operation Warp Speed](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/05/15/trump-administration-announces-framework-and-leadership-for-operation-warp-speed.html)) but this is highly uncertain due to the many steps in the logistical supply chain that [could become bottlenecks](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html) and the uncertainty over which type of vaccine will prove efficacious and safe first. For context, the [US Department of Defense estimated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5518734/) that it would take 7 years to design, build, validate, and commence commercial manufacturing on a 3-product facility. Once the vaccine is being manufactured there will probably also be a [tiered access scheme](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/line-forming-covid-19-vaccine-who-should-be-front) and you will be placed in a tier depending on whether you are an essential worker or in an at-risk group.
